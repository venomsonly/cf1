CI/CD.

The flow:
1. One git repo with multiple branches.
2. Each site will have its own branch.
3. Each git branch will contain a .env file and assets (can be local or use api-server).

To-DO:
1. Create a git repo (main branch) with the name 'amt-15-mb-sites'
2. Make amit collaborator for this repo.
3. Make the main branch working for one site. Say 'handyman.us'
4. From the main branch create a new branch with domain name. Say 'handyman.us'
5. Push the new branch to GitHub.

Note:
1. Branch names main, dev, testing will be excluded.
2. Branch name must be the site domain name. Say for site handyman.us, the branch name will be 'handyman.us'.
